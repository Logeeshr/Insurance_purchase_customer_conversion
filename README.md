# Insurance_purchase_customer_conversion
# Customer Conversion prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms
## Promblem Statement

#### You are working for a new-age insurance company and employ mutiple outreach plans to sell term insurance to your customers. Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way to reach out to people however they incur a lot of cost. Hence, it is important to identify the customers that are most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically targeted via call. We are given the historical marketing data of the insurance company and are required to build a ML model that will predict if a client will subscribe to the insurance. 

## Dataset
 ### Features
 1. Age (age of person)
 2. Job (type of job)
 3. Marital (marital status)
 4. educational_qual (education status)
 5. call_type (contact communication type) 
 6. day:last contact day of the month (numeric) 
 7. mon: last contact month of year
 8. dur: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric)
 9. num_calls: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client
 10. prev_outcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: "unknown","other","failure","success")
 
 ### Target 
 11. Y - has the client subscribed to the insurance?(YES/NO)
